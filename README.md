## Extra notes

- As an exercise, this project wasn’t focused on advanced optimizations regarding data storage, processing, accessibility, scalability, cross-browser compatibility, etc. There’s still a lot to be done about it.
- As most projects, this one is not bug/error-free. If you find any bug or unexpected behavior, feel free to get in touch, here is my email - dfaferreira46@gmail.com
